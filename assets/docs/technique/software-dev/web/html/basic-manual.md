# HTML Basic Manual

I know you want to say that, "HTML is very simple". Because before to day, I thought so too.

But now, I learned something new about "HTML Element Nesting Structure".

There are some basic rules:

- [Interactive content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Content_categories#interactive_content) should not be nested in any other interactive content.
- `h1` ~ `h6` can only contain [phrasing content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Content_categories#phrasing_content).
- `label` & `p` can only accept [phrasing content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Content_categories#phrasing_content) except itself.
- [Void elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Void_element) can not contain any content, they must be closed by a self-closing tag.

For more details, you can find the specific element's **Technical Summary** from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements).

FUCKING HTML!!!
